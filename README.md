# Live-Emotion-detection
This project is about detecting emoticons in text using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented using various libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

## Project Description
The project aims to detect emotions from facial expressions using a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of facial images. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a fully connected neural network. The CNN is used to extract features from the facial images, and the fully connected neural network is used to classify the extracted features.

The dataset used for training the model consists of thousands of facial images, which are preprocessed using OpenCV. The preprocessed images are then fed into the CNN for feature extraction. The extracted features are then passed into the fully connected neural network for classification.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using various metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Finally, the results of the model are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Conclusion
The emoticons detection project is an exciting application of machine learning techniques. By using a combination of CNN and LSTM networks, the project is able to accurately detect emoticons in text. The project can be extended to other applications such as sentiment analysis and social media analysis.
