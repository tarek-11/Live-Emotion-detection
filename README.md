# Live-Emotion-detection
This project is about detecting emoticons in text using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented using various libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

## Project Description
The project aims to detect emoticons in text using a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of emoticons. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The CNN is used to extract features from the emoticon images, and the LSTM is used to classify the extracted features.

The dataset used for training the model consists of thousands of emoticon images, which are preprocessed using OpenCV. The preprocessed images are then fed into the CNN for feature extraction. The extracted features are then passed into the LSTM for classification.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using various metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Finally, the results of the model are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:
- TensorFlow

- Matplotlib
## Conclusion
The emoticons detection project is an exciting application of machine learning techniques. By using a combination of CNN and LSTM networks, the project is able to accurately detect emoticons in text. The project can be extended to other applications such as sentiment analysis and social media analysis.
